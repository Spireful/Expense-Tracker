add categories (or part of it)
during deletion; give option to delete again or go back to menu (half)

ignore:

Duplicate Expense Names
Adding an expense with a name that already exists will overwrite the previous value without warning.

Deleting Non-existent Expense
If the user tries to delete an expense that doesn't exist, the code prints an error, but doesn't show available keys for reference.

Expense Name Input
If the user enters an empty string for the expense name, it will be added as '' (empty key) in the dictionary.

Expense Amount Input
If the user enters a negative number or zero, it will be accepted as a valid expense. You may want to restrict this.

Menu Choice Input
Pressing Enter without input in the menu will be treated as an invalid choice, but the code will keep prompting.

Deleting All Expenses
If all expenses are deleted, subsequent calculations or views should handle the empty dictionary gracefully.

Case Sensitivity in Deletion
Expense names are stored in lowercase, but if the user enters a name with different casing during deletion, it may not match.

Non-numeric Input for Amount
The code handles non-numeric input for amount, but the error message says "Please enter an Integer" even though floats are accepted.

Large Numbers or Float Precision
Very large numbers or floats with many decimal places may not be displayed as intended.
